## 1. Percolation
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html

Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.

##Percolation
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.

##Model
We model a percolation system using an N-by-N grid of sites. Each site is either open or blocked. A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites. We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row. 

##Percolates
The problem. In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question: if sites are independently set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p), what is the probability that the system percolates? When p equals 0, the system does not percolate; when p equals 1, the system percolates.

## 2. Deques and Randomized Queues
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html

Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

Corner cases. Throw a java.lang.NullPointerException if the client attempts to add a null item; throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client attempts to remove an item from an empty deque; throw a java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the client calls the remove() method in the iterator; throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls the next() method in the iterator and there are no more items to return.

Performance requirements.   Your deque implementation must support each deque operation in constant worst-case time. A deque containing n items must use at most 48n + 192 bytes of memory. and use space proportional to the number of items currently in the deque. Additionally, your iterator implementation must support each operation (including construction) in constant worst-case time.
