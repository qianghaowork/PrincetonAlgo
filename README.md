## 1. Percolation
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html

Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.

##Percolation
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.

##Model
We model a percolation system using an N-by-N grid of sites. Each site is either open or blocked. A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites. We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row. 

##Percolates
The problem. In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question: if sites are independently set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 − p), what is the probability that the system percolates? When p equals 0, the system does not percolate; when p equals 1, the system percolates.

## 2. Deques and Randomized Queues
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html

Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

##Corner cases. 
Throw a java.lang.NullPointerException if the client attempts to add a null item; throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client attempts to remove an item from an empty deque; throw a java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the client calls the remove() method in the iterator; throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls the next() method in the iterator and there are no more items to return.

##Performance requirements.   
Your deque implementation must support each deque operation in constant worst-case time. A deque containing n items must use at most 48n + 192 bytes of memory. and use space proportional to the number of items currently in the deque. Additionally, your iterator implementation must support each operation (including construction) in constant worst-case time.

## 3. Colinear Points
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html

Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.

## Brute force
Write a program BruteCollinearPoints.java that examines 4 points at a time and checks whether they all lie on the same line segment, returning all such line segments. To check whether the 4 points p, q, r, and s are collinear, check whether the three slopes between p and q, between p and r, and between p and s are all equal.

The method segments() should include each line segment containing 4 points exactly once. If 4 points appear on a line segment in the order p→q→r→s, then you should include either the line segment p→s or s→p (but not both) and you should not include subsegments such as p→r or q→r. For simplicity, we will not supply any input to BruteCollinearPoints that has 5 or more collinear points.

## Fast sorting-based solution

Remarkably, it is possible to solve the problem much faster than the brute-force solution described above. Given a point p, the following method determines whether p participates in a set of 4 or more collinear points.

Think of p as the origin.
For each other point q, determine the slope it makes with p.
Sort the points according to the slopes they makes with p.
Check if any 3 (or more) adjacent points in the sorted order have equal slopes with respect to p. If so, these points, together with p, are collinear.

## 4. 8 Puzzle
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html

The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank square. The following shows a sequence of legal moves from an initial board (left) to the goal board (right).


    1  3        1     3        1  2  3        1  2  3        1  2  3
 4  2  5   =>   4  2  5   =>   4     5   =>   4  5      =>   4  5  6
 7  8  6        7  8  6        7  8  6        7  8  6        7  8

## 5. Kd-Trees

http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree.html

Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.

## 2d-tree implementation

Write a mutable data type KdTree.java that uses a 2d-tree to implement the same API (but replace PointSET with KdTree). A 2d-tree is a generalization of a BST to two-dimensional keys. The idea is to build a BST with points in the nodes, using the x- and y-coordinates of the points as keys in strictly alternating sequence.

### Search and insert
The algorithms for search and insert are similar to those for BSTs, but at the root we use the x-coordinate (if the point to be inserted has a smaller x-coordinate than the point at the root, go left; otherwise go right); then at the next level, we use the y-coordinate (if the point to be inserted has a smaller y-coordinate than the point in the node, go left; otherwise go right); then at the next level the x-coordinate, and so forth.

### Draw 
A 2d-tree divides the unit square in a simple way: all the points to the left of the root go in the left subtree; all those to the right go in the right subtree; and so forth, recursively. Your draw() method should draw all of the points to standard draw in black and the subdivisions in red (for vertical splits) and blue (for horizontal splits). This method need not be efficient—it is primarily for debugging.
